        User Defined Datatype. Its IS Reference Datatype. For Example Number Is Datatype It is Defined by
        JS Dev . So It Has A Definition . So Like That Object Also. Reference is Data Nd theri operations
        grouping Way . Object Is Reference Type Instance Means Blueprint . Constructor Is Instance create
        Way.
  
    Syntax : 
        variable name = new Object(); --> Object is Constructor.
        instanceof --> shows which reference type .
        It Has Property And Its Value . We Access the Value By USing '.' Symbol.

        Ex : 
         var student = new Object();
         student.name =' Devsk ';  --> name property | devsk --> value
         student.dep = ' CSE '
         Console.log(student.name);
         console.log(student.dep);

   2. We Can Create a funciton inn object In object it called Method . It operates on object property 
      value.

   3. Difference b\w primitive and reference Datatypes.

   4.There Is no Fixed Size In Object reference.

   5. primitive valuies stored in stack object values stored in Heap. --> like pointers. Object Referes 
      reference of the obbject that means data Nd methods.
