   
    Def :
        User Defined Datatype. Its IS Reference Datatype. For Example Number Is Datatype It is Defined by
        JS Dev . So It Has A Definition . So Like That Object Also. Reference is Data Nd their operations
        grouping Way . Object Is Reference Type Instance Means Blueprint . Constructor Is Instance create
        Way.
  
    Syntax : 
        variable name = new Object(); --> Object is Constructor.
        instanceof --> shows which reference type .
        It Has Property And Its Value . We Access the Value By USing '.' Symbol.

        Ex : 
         var student = new Object();
         student.name =' Devsk ';  --> name property | devsk --> value
         student.dep = ' CSE '
         Console.log(student.name);
         console.log(student.dep);

   2. We Can Create a function in object In object it called Method . It operates on object property 
      value.

   3. Difference b\w primitive and reference Datatypes.

   4.There Is no Fixed Size In Object reference.

   5. primitive values stored in stack | object values stored in Heap. --> like pointers. Object Referes 
      reference of the obbject that means data Nd methods.
   6. ES Standard the Object is collection of values is might be primitive or reference values.

   7. Second method to create a Object --> var obj = {} 

   8. This Keyword is used to refer the same object.

   9. We can Use  [] To Add a property in object. we can also use variable to add property By [].

   10. For In Loop Is used To access The property In the Object 
     
       Syntax : 

        For ( variable in objname){

        }
    11. Object has Default prototype Object.

    12. hasWonproperty() --> used to check the property is here on the OwnObject. 

    13.In Js there Is restriction to the Property . let Us see . there Is two Type Of restriction property
        1.Data Property.
        2.Accessor property .

    14. Data Property -> Dataproperty Is Data Value storing location. In this location we Can R/W.
        In ES 5 Internal Attribute Write in [[Attribute name]] .

    15.In Data Property there Is Four attribute. By default the Attribute Set As True.

       1.Value --> The actual Values is Stored.
       2.Writable --> The Value is writable or not | permission.
       3.Enumerable --> display or not in for in loop.
       4.Configurable --> the above mentioned attribute Configurable or not | permission .
    
    16.Object.defineproperty() --> used to define the property of the data property.By using the 
       defineproperty the Default value Is false.
       
       Syntax : 
    Object.defineProperty(object , 'property name' , {
        four attribute values true | false 
    })

   17. Delete Keyword Used to Delete the variable or datatype.

   18. Accessor Property --> we cant store the data value. there Is two Funcions.These functions Invoke 
       read And Write time. Sometime We Have Some Changes to Modify the Property that time Accessor
       property will use.

       In this function We add New Property and check the property value and upadte the existing value.

       1.GET --> function work normal return the value
       2.SET --> function get the given value and do some validations nd return.

       Syntax: 
       Object.defineProperty(object, 'prop name',{
        get: function(),
        set: function()
       })
    
    19. Creating Objects : 
        Constructor Function Is defined by New prefix keyword .

    20.When We create function and When we call the new Keyword is used automatically convert the 
       function into Object.
    
    21. In Object Constructor Function We use the function First letter as Capitial for Differentiate.
